# Caliper

Calipur is a combination of a few little scripts that I am using to detect your browser width and then trigger functions based on that size.

## Why?

Responsive/Adaptive Design

## How?

Grab the code from scripts.js and throw it in your code. Note that there is some blocking going on where I am assigning the resize and load events. If you don't like that, change it. I include scripts just before the body tag, and so far I haven't expereinced any load issues, that being said remember, IT. IS. BLOCKING.

## Tested Browsers

- IE8+
- Chrome 34.0.1832.1 canary SyzyASan
- Chrome 32.0.1700.107 m
- Chrome 32.0.1700.99 (Android 4.4.0)

## Future?

Maybe a plugin, maybe some clean up of the code. I may even add some retinafication to this to let you know your pixel density ratio.
